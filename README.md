## Features

- [X] For the login part, our backend is not yet ready, so you will need to mock the backend responses, and do a "local" login until the backend is ready.
- [X] When our catstomers enter our app, we want that they see an alphabetical ordered list of all the cat breeds that are available.
- [X] Customers should be able to filter the breeds by country.
- [X] Each cat breed will be shown in a "card" with a small image on the left side, and the name and description of the cat breed in the rest of the card.
- [X] When a card is tapped, we will show a details page, where we will put the image, the name, description, country code, the temperament and Wikipedia link of the breed.

## Requirements

- iOS 15.5+
